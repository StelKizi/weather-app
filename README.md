# Weather App

An app that uses the API from the [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/current) to display the current weather conditions in the specified city.

The [Geolocation Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) was also used in combination with OpenWeatherAPI to display the location of the user and present the weather data in the location of the  user.
